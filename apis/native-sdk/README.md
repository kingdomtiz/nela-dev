# Native SDK

The APP development team and developers can directly learn and understand the EDFS underlying protocol, and complete the development of NativeApp by integrating the EDFS underlying Native SDK. Readers can read this development manual to understand all the interfaces open to the outside world by the EDFS underlying SDK, as well as the interface descriptions, and complete the development of Native APPs that conform to the EDFS protocol specifications.​

EDFS-SDK is developed in C++ language and provides full platform support, including Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, Mac Operation systems.

​EDFS-SDK uses the standard function export method of each platform to export the external interface, which can be called directly by external languages that support calling c++ modules.

The EDFS-SDK library also provides corresponding support for some language which does not support calling C++ modules directly. For example, for JAVA language development, the EDFS-SDK library provides special JNI interface to support. EDFS-SDK also provides corresponding support for languages that do not support C++ specific features, such as GO language. If the development language you use has obstacles to call the EDFS-SDK library, please contact the EDFS development team, and we will develop and support it. There will be separate SDK documentation for each language, which you can refer to accordingly.
