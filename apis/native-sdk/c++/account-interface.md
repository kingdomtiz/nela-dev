# Account Interface



### g the Default Algorithm

Set the current default algorithm.

```
INT32 TSK_SetDefaultCipher(BYTE * tagCipher);
```

<details>

<summary>Parameters</summary>

* CHAR \*
  * tagCipher - the algorithm tag to be obtained (that is, the GUID label of the algorithm), which is fixed to 16 bytes (this parameter can be NULL, indicating that the default algorithm is specified) \[IN]

</details>

<details>

<summary>Return Values</summary>

* INT32
  * KError\_Success success
  * KError\_CipherError, failed, the algorithm could not be found;
  * KError\_Other, other errors, usually memory allocation errors (or insufficient buffers);

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
The default algorithm is set through this interface on the application layer interface.

If the specified algorithm tag is NULL during encryption, the default algorithm will be used for encryption.
